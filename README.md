Perfect—*editorinmind* with the tagline updated to "fictional scenes" has a clear identity. Here's a polished draft of your `README.md` with a thoughtful balance of clarity and tone, and a light touch of emojis to make it welcoming without being overly casual:

# ✍️ editorinmind

**A benchmark for evaluating AI as a developmental editor through author-guided, question-driven feedback on fictional scenes.**

## 📚 About

**EditorInMind** is a benchmark designed to assess how well LLM-based tools support fiction writers in the self-editing process. Unlike tools that suggest direct edits or rewrites, this benchmark evaluates AI's ability to act as a thoughtful editorial companion—one that poses insightful, open-ended questions to the author to guide their revision process.

The goal is simple but essential:  
🧠 **Keep creative control in the hands of the author** while using AI to spark reflection, deepen narrative choices, and strengthen developmental aspects of the story.

## 🧭 Philosophy

AI should help writers **think**, not write for them.

This benchmark treats AI as:
- A careful reader
- A developmental editor
- A source of constructive, scene-specific questions
- A tool that supports authorial agency and creative autonomy

## 🛠️ How It Works

Each evaluation consists of:
1. A scene from a fictional work (provided by the user).
2. A prompt placing the AI in the role of a literary agent performing **developmental editing**.
3. A set of criteria for reviewing the AI's **question-based feedback**, including:
   - Does the AI sense tension or pacing issues?
   - What feels missing or underdeveloped in the scene?
   - What sparks curiosity?
   - What builds anticipation for what comes next?

## 🔬 Use Cases

- Evaluating different LLMs and tools (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Supporting writers in early-stage revisions
- Testing prompt design for AI-assisted writing workflows
- Developing custom AI writing tools that preserve author voice and intention
