# 🛠️ storycraft_prompts

This folder contains a collection of **targeted developmental editing prompts** designed to guide authors through specific aspects of fiction craft—one scene at a time.

Each prompt invites the AI to function as a careful reader and literary agent, asking only **open-ended, reflective questions** focused on a single dimension of storytelling. The goal is to help the author revisit and revise their work with greater clarity, control, and creative intent.

These prompts do **not** suggest edits or changes. Instead, they are crafted to foster deeper inquiry into the mechanics of a scene—encouraging the author to refine voice, structure, theme, character, and more on their own terms.

## 🎯 Areas of Focus

Each file in this folder corresponds to one area of narrative craft:

- `character_depth.md` – Questions to probe motivation, interiority, and development
- `setting_and_atmosphere.md` – Questions about place, mood, and symbolic space
- `scene_structure_and_flow.md` – Questions about movement, escalation, and shape
- `dialogue_and_subtext.md` – Questions about voice, rhythm, and what's left unsaid
- `thematic_resonance.md` – Questions connecting the scene to broader story ideas
- `narrative_voice.md` – Questions exploring tone, perspective, and language
- `point_of_view.md` – Questions examining how the reader’s access to events is shaped

More prompt templates can be added to explore intersections (e.g., voice + character) or to focus on revision strategies specific to literary fiction.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. Choose the prompt that aligns with the craft aspect you want to evaluate.
2. Replace the `[title]` and `[one-line description]` placeholders with your novel’s details.
3. Feed the prompt and your fictional scene to an LLM-based tool.
4. Review the AI’s **questions**, not answers. The benchmark evaluates how well the tool supports reflective revision without taking creative control from the author.
