| **14.3** | *Window of the Brides* (Federico) | In his Corrientes‑loft, Federico drinks with colleague Ignacio; they spar over Andrea’s near‑death, Federico’s reclusive drift, and a possible return to teaching, admitting he’ll look after Andrea yet fearing his own inertia.                       |
| **14.4** | *Mother’s Visit* (Andrea)         | Heavily bandaged, Andrea endures her vain mother Valeria’s shopping display; Valeria plans to whisk her to Las Flores (or the family cabin in Pehuenia) and resign for her at the museum, while Andrea quietly decides to abandon Buenos Aires herself. |
| **14.5** | *New Rules* (Daniel)              | Back at Ramiro’s door Daniel vows to erase the past—keeping only the knife, the alias, and a vow to paint over the city’s “false walls.” He settles into an anxious half‑life, ready to bolt whenever the next shadow appears.                          |

| **15.1** | *A Check & a Clause* (Torcuato)    | Andrea’s stylish mother Valeria visits the museum: she resigns on Andrea’s behalf yet hands Torcuato a large donation—**ear‑marked only for acquiring works by Jewish painters**—and charms him into promising a gala in Las Flores.                                                      |
| **15.2** | *Empty Rooms* (Daniel)             | Drawn back to Andrea’s block, Daniel slips into the flat while her brother Manuel supervises movers. He buys a dull street‑scene canvas for ₱250, discovers Andrea’s cryptic note (“Minkowski is no more…”) taped on its back, and takes a neglected balcony plant as a fragile keepsake. |
| **15.3** | *New Cell, New Artefacts* (Daniel) | In Ramiro’s bare loan‑flat Daniel hangs the painting, realises older layers hide another work, and pockets the note; armed only with a gaucho knife and the plant, he vows to visit the museum at dawn to learn whether the true Minkowski is still there.                                |
| **15.4** | *Window Talk* (Federico)           | Drinking with colleague Ignacio in the bridal‑sign loft, Federico spars over guilt and inertia; he resolves to look after Andrea yet admits he may “cut people out” when they die.

| **15.5** | *Departure Plans* (Andrea)         | Bandaged in hospital, Andrea endures Valeria’s vanity shopping spree.

| **15.6** | *Back to the Lectern* (Federico)   | Federico meets Dean Ravizzoli; after apologising for past drunken antics he secures a theory course (with junior Carlos as watchdog) and silently promises not to fail this new batch of students—even if he still doubts his worth.                                                      |

| **16.1** | *Sleepless Canvas* (Daniel)                 | Alone with the over‑painted Minkowski, Daniel spirals: rage, shame, sexual numbness. Andrea’s blue note (“Minkowski is no more… love people the only way you can”) drives him into the night, knife in pocket, hunting answers. |
| **16.2** | *Anarchist Lullaby* (Daniel & Chabiano)     | At the archivos de anarquistas, Señora Chabiano’s quiet compassion steadies him. She urges Daniel to see Museo Judío and its curator Nudelbaum for clues about Minkowski.                                                       |
| **16.3** | *Ticket to Once* (Daniel)                   | A bus ride, a scribbled micro‑poem on the ticket (“He stood a distant beat…”) wedged into the seat: Daniel’s first anonymous act of atonement.                                                                                  |
| **16.4** | *Layers of Loss* (Daniel & Nudelbaum)       | In Museo Judío Daniel studies two authentic Minkowskis; Nudelbaum reveals Torcuato’s odd query about a “missing” piece, hinting the museum never owned one legitimately.                                                        |

| **16.6** | *Balcony Re‑entry* (Daniel & Manuel)        | Daniel slips into Andrea’s apartment during the move, buys the doctored street‑scene canvas for ₱250 from her brother Manuel, and takes a dying balcony plant – clues and penance in tow.                                       |
| **16.7** | *Hospital Confrontation* (Daniel & Andrea)  | He confesses at Andrea’s bedside; she refuses forgiveness but hints that the painting hides truth: “Look closely, then go to Once.” Nurses eject him as Andrea brands the Brazilians the real killers.                          |
| **16.8** | *Knife & Nightlife* (Daniel, Ramiro, Maria) | Ramiro and Maria drag Daniel to Gallery Night; he panics in a show that eerily echoes Andrea; outside, ex‑gallery‑assistant Gaston shadows Daniel, intent on cashing in Mirtha’s last favour.                                   |
| **16.9** | *A Call to Blood* (Gaston & Dos Santos)     | Gaston tails Daniel to his new San Telmo address and phones fugitive Gilberto Dos Santos in Brazil, selling the location for promised cash – unleashing fresh danger.                                                           |

| **17.1** | *First Steps* (Andrea + Nurse Carolina)      | Carolina coaxes bruised‑and‑braced Andrea out of bed; stiff but upright, she begins physio—until Federico arrives, pledging knight‑errantry. Andrea registers only exhaustion and distrust.         |
| **17.2** | *Dragons & Handrails* (Andrea • Physio room) | With Carolina and a cheerful therapist, Andrea walks the parallel bars while Federico hovers. His presence highlights new distance; Andrea jokes with the therapist, freezing Federico out.         |
| **17.3** | *Discharge Papers* (Andrea ↔ Mother Valeria) | Doctor okays release; Valeria sweeps Andrea to a luxe Puerto Madero condo, chattering about gyms and décor. Andrea, on crutches, longs for solitude and mourns lost autonomy.                       |
| **17.4** | *Glass‑Tower Refuge* (Andrea)                | Among 24‑floor views and Valeria’s fussing, Andrea tests her crutches, debates future: museum career dead, maybe teaching art to kids. Tears flow once mother leaves—first private grief released.  |
| **17.5** | *Shattered Bouquet* (Federico)               | In his loft Federico stages a private tempest: dozens of roses smashed, petals everywhere. Fury, guilt and self‑pity culminate in collapse at the foot of an empty easel—love and mastery in ruins. |

| **18.2** | *Sky‑Box Prison* (Andrea)                             | Installed in her mother’s Puerto Madero tower, Andrea tests her crutches, resents Valeria’s pampering, vows to abandon museum work, and weeps alone for the first time since the fall.                                                                  |
| **18.3** | *Bouquet Rage* (Federico)                             | In his loft, Federico rehearses lectures, smashes roses, and spirals into drunken self‑loathing amid a litter of empty Vasco Viejo bottles.                                                                                                             |

| **19.1** | *Night‑Muralist* (Daniel)                           | Before dawn, Daniel claims the museo’s west wall, bargains crates from two homeless men and—working by street‑lamp—drafts a blue‑and‑orange immigrant mural that will hold the ruined Minkowski. One last “ingredient” is still missing.                                                                                          |
| **19.2** | *Debt to a Widow* (Daniel ↔ Señora Chabiano)        | He bursts into the anarchist archives, apologetically removes the street‑scene painting he’d gifted, promises an original in exchange, and borrows her phone to arrange a clandestine hand‑off at Constitución station.                                                                                                           |
| **19.3** | *Parcel for the Director* (Torcuato)                | Wrestling next‑year’s budget, Capusoto is forced to accept a painting-sized package delivered “only to you.” In private he unwraps it—**the genuine “Departing Gdansk.”** Jubilant yet uneasy, he pours a victory glass of Achával Ferrer, oblivious to the mural taking shape outside.                                           |
| **19.4** | *Reveal at the Red Wall* (Daniel ↔ Andrea ↔ Ramiro) | Mid‑morning Daniel drags Andrea (via taxi) and a baffled Ramiro behind the museum. He pastes the battered Minkowski into the centre of his fresh mural, titles the work **“Tracing the Void,”** fends off a heckling vagrant, and topples into the grass beside them—declaring the cycle of forgery, guilt and violence finished. |
