| **1.1** | *Mirtha’s Empty Flat* (Daniel)        | Daniel slips on a thrift‑shop morning coat and his signature red gloves in Mirtha’s apartment, relishing the charade of lover‑lodger‑forger as he steels himself for a night of manipulation.                 |
| **1.2** | *Cab through Neon and Noise* (Daniel) | During a tense taxi ride to Barracas, Daniel watches juggling street kids and a pleading girl press her palm to the glass while the driver spits “thieves” and the city’s lights smear across the windshield. |
